stlc-softwere testing life cycle
stlc phases
============
            1.   requirement gathering,
			     participant
			     ===========
			1.client
			2.business analyst

            2.   test planing,
			
			1.what to test
			2.how to test
			3.when to test
			
			3.   test designing,
			creaton of scenerio===> highlevel scenero like (logn,search button,add to crat.., etc..)
			test case( through excel) excepted,actual is called validate
			why you write the test case ?===> to avoid the mistake
			verfcaton (ststic testng) and  valdation(dynamic testing)
			    verfcaton (ststic testng)
			    walkthrough
			    code review
			    document reviwe
			
			valdation(dynamic testing)
			  excepted and actual result
            			
			                                                         RTM  (reuirement  traceblity  matrix)
			4.  enviromental setup,test executon,
			manual and also automation(low test case is manual testng,high test cse automation testing)
			
			5.   defect reporting,
			
			ERROR==human eror
			BUG=== find out by developer
			DEFECT== find out by tester
			
			rsising the defect in jira-to developer
			
			
			defect life cycle
			==================
			
			
			
			new--in jira creatig the defect
			
			open --developer started work on defect
			
			fixed-- code  changed to correct the defect 
			
			retest--tester will retesting defect
